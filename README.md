# DeliChat

## Description

Just moved out from your parentsâ€™ ?  
Instant noodles burn through the stomach ?  
No money for a decent dinner in a restaurant ?  

No worries!  
DeliChat will find for you simple, healthy and  
delicious recipes, fitting your tastes and needs.  

Ask for specific dishes or list the available ingredients.  
Follow the instructions and enjoy the results.  

## Why does the chatbot exist, anyway?

Well, people like to eat deliciously.
But seriously, DeliChat is a university project for the course "Internet Technologies", at the Deggendorf institute of Technology.
Thus, it serves not only as a foolproof companion for your gastronomy adventures but has also become a source of valuable experience for the team of students who created it.

## Who is in the team?

Hardworking, motivated and creative people only. 
At the time of completing the chatbot, we are 2'nd semester students pursuing a bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Deggendorf Institute of Technology. 
Our roles in the project were allocated according to our skills. Nevertheless, we actively engaged in various tasks beyond our assigned roles, developing proficiency in multiple areas.
